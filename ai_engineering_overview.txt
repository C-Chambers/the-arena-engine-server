Sprint 1 Engineering Setup & PlanDocument Version: 1.0From: Engineering TeamTo: Lead Project ManagerSubject: Sprint 1 Plan for Backend and Frontend Setup.ObjectiveTo establish clean, consistent, and scalable development environments for both the backend and frontend. This includes scaffolding the projects, selecting core libraries, and defining a standardized code structure.Part 1: Backend Setup (Node.js)The backend will be responsible for the authoritative game logic, WebSocket communication, and database interactions.Project Scaffolding:Initialize a new Node.js project (npm init).Core Libraries to Install:express: The web server framework for handling non-game HTTP requests (like login/registration).ws: A robust, high-performance WebSocket library for our real-time game communication.pg: The standard Node.js client for interfacing with our PostgreSQL database.dotenv: To manage environment variables (database credentials, server ports, etc.) securely.nodemon: A development utility that will automatically restart the server on file changes, speeding up our workflow.Initial Project Structure:/src
├── /config         // Database connections, environment variables
├── /controllers    // Handles incoming HTTP request logic
├── /routes         // Express route definitions
├── /services       // Business logic (e.g., matchmaking, game state)
└── server.js       // Main entry point, initializes server
Sprint 1 Goals:Initialize the Node.js project and install all core dependencies.Set up a basic Express server that listens on a configured port.Create a simple database connection script within /config to verify connectivity to PostgreSQL.Configure nodemon in package.json for the development script.
