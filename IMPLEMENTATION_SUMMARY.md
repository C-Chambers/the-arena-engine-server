# Inuzuka Kiba Backend Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the backend implementation for the new character "Inuzuka Kiba, the Beast Tamer" according to Steps 1.1-1.4 of the implementation plan.

## Implemented Features

### Step 1.2: Persistent AoE Damage
**Location**: `processTurnBasedEffects()` function in `/workspace/src/game/engine.js`

**Implementation**:
- Added logic to check for `persistent_aoe_damage` status on characters at the end of each turn
- When a character has this status, it applies damage to ALL living enemies
- The damage respects existing damage reduction and shield mechanics
- Added appropriate logging for transparency

**How it works**:
1. At end of turn, scan all characters for `persistent_aoe_damage` status
2. For each character with this status, deal damage to all living enemies
3. Apply damage reduction and shield logic as normal
4. Log all damage dealt and character defeats

### Step 1.3: Cost Reduction Empowerment  
**Location**: `canAffordCost()` and `executeTurn()` functions in `/workspace/src/game/engine.js`

**Implementation**:
- Modified `canAffordCost()` to accept an optional `casterId` parameter
- Added logic to check for `cost_reduction` status on the caster
- When present, reduces the Random chakra cost by the specified amount
- Updated `executeTurn()` to apply cost reductions before deducting chakra
- Updated `queueSkill()` to pass casterId for cost validation

**How it works**:
1. When calculating if a skill can be afforded, check if caster has `cost_reduction` status
2. If found, modify the cost by the `cost_change` value (negative numbers reduce cost)
3. Apply the modified cost when validating and deducting chakra

### Step 1.4: Targeting Restriction & Buff Immunity
**Location**: `queueSkill()` and `processSingleSkill()` functions in `/workspace/src/game/engine.js`

**Implementation**:

#### Targeting Restriction:
- Added validation in `queueSkill()` for "Dynamic Air Marking" skill
- Prevents targeting enemies already affected by `dynamic_air_mark` status
- Returns appropriate error message when restriction is violated

#### Buff Immunity:
- Added logic in `processSingleSkill()` to check for `dynamic_air_mark` status
- Characters with this status cannot receive defensive effects:
  - Shield effects (`add_shield`)
  - Damage reduction status (`damage_reduction`)
  - Invulnerability status (`invulnerable`)
- Added appropriate logging when immunity blocks effects

**How it works**:
1. **Targeting**: Before queueing "Dynamic Air Marking", check if target already has the mark
2. **Buff Immunity**: Before applying defensive effects, check if target has `dynamic_air_mark`
3. If immunity applies, skip the effect and log the immunity message

## Character Data Structure

### Character
```json
{
  "name": "Inuzuka Kiba, the Beast Tamer",
  "max_hp": 100,
  "image_url": "https://example.com/characters/inuzuka_kiba.jpg"
}
```

### Skills

#### 1. Dynamic Air Marking
- **Cost**: 1 Random chakra
- **Effect**: Applies `dynamic_air_mark` status for 3 turns
- **Mechanics**: Prevents target from receiving defensive benefits

#### 2. Double Headed Wolf  
- **Cost**: 2 Random chakra
- **Effects**: 
  - Applies `persistent_aoe_damage` status (10 damage/turn for 3 turns)
  - Applies `cost_reduction` status for Garouga (-1 Random chakra for 3 turns)
- **Cooldown**: 4 turns

#### 3. Garouga
- **Cost**: 1 Random chakra (reduced by Double Headed Wolf)
- **Effect**: 25 damage to single target
- **Enhanced by**: Cost reduction from Double Headed Wolf

#### 4. Smoke Bomb
- **Cost**: 1 Random chakra  
- **Effect**: Applies `invulnerable` status for 1 turn
- **Cooldown**: 4 turns

## Status Effects Added

1. **persistent_aoe_damage**: Deals damage to all enemies at end of turn
2. **cost_reduction**: Reduces chakra cost of specified skill
3. **dynamic_air_mark**: Prevents defensive buffs and marks for targeting restriction

## Files Modified

1. `/workspace/src/game/engine.js`:
   - `processTurnBasedEffects()` - Added persistent AoE damage logic
   - `canAffordCost()` - Added cost reduction logic  
   - `queueSkill()` - Added targeting restriction validation
   - `processSingleSkill()` - Added buff immunity logic
   - `executeTurn()` - Updated to apply cost reductions

## Next Steps

### Step 1.1: Database & Data Preparation
To complete the implementation, use the admin panel to:

1. **Create the character** using the data from `inuzuka_kiba_character_data.json`
2. **Create the four skills** with the provided JSON structures
3. **Update skill references**: After creating Garouga, update the Double Headed Wolf skill's `skillId` field with Garouga's actual database ID

### Testing Recommendations

1. Test persistent AoE damage with Double Headed Wolf
2. Test cost reduction by using Double Headed Wolf then Garouga  
3. Test targeting restriction by attempting to mark the same enemy twice
4. Test buff immunity by marking an enemy then trying to shield them
5. Verify all status effects expire correctly after their duration

## Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible with existing characters and skills. The new mechanics only activate when the specific status effects are present, so existing gameplay is unaffected.
